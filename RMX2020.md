### **FAQs**
1. I can’t boot into RECOVERY mode after flashing this ROM
- You can, just not with the key combo. Realme have mapped that combo to bootloader instead of recovery unlike in RealmeUI-1.0.
Enable Advanced restart from `Settings->Essence->Miscellaneous->Enable advance restart` and use that to reboot into the RECOVERY mode
2. Can I flash other custom recoveries?
- Not recommended but Yes, you can. Make sure that recovery is compatible with RealmeUI-2.0
